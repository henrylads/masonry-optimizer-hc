# Project Structure Rules

## Directory Structure
All code must follow this structure:
```
masonry-optimizer/
├── src/                # All source code
│   ├── app/           # Next.js pages and API routes
│   ├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── data/          # Data management and lookups
│   ├── calculations/  # Core calculation modules
│   ├── components/    # React components
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions
├── docs/             # All documentation
└── tests/            # Test files
```

## Key Rules

1. **Source Code**
   - All code MUST be in appropriate subdirectories of `src/`
   - No source code outside `src/`
   - No nested `src` directories

2. **Types**
   - All types MUST be in `src/types/`
   - Each domain should have its own type file
   - Export through `types/index.ts`

3. **Genetic Algorithm**
   - All genetic algorithm functions are within the src/app/calculations/geneticAlgorithm directory
   - One index file is used to import each part of the genetic algorithm
   - sub-directories include populationGeneration, fitnessScoring, selectionAndBreeding, and converganceAndStopping
