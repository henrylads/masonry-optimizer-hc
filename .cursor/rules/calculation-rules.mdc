## Calculation Rules {#calculation-rules}

Precision Requirements for Engineering Calculations

1\. Floating-Point Precision:  
\- All intermediate calculations must maintain full decimal precision  
\- No rounding should occur until the final display of results  
\- When working with very small numbers (\< 0.0001), use all available decimal places

2\. Critical Variables:  
\- Constants like 'a' in quadratic equations must be defined to at least 12 decimal places  
\- Example: a \= 0.0000003968253968 (not 3.96825e-7)

3\. Step-by-Step Verification:  
\- Each intermediate calculation should be logged with at least 12 decimal places  
\- For critical engineering values like forces, moments, and stresses, show values to at least 5 decimal places  
\- For quadratic equations, explicitly show:  
  \* Individual components (e.g., b², 4ac)  
  \* Discriminant value (b²-4ac)  
  \* Final result

4\. Units and Conversions:  
\- All unit conversions must maintain full precision  
\- Document units at each calculation step

5\. Validation Steps:  
\- Include validation steps comparing intermediate values to known checkpoints  
\- Flag any deviations larger than 0.00001 in engineering units
