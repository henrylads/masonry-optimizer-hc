# Progress Documentation - Fixing Position Optimization Fix

## Issue Identified

**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Problem**: Fixing position optimization not working correctly on small slabs

### Specific Case Study
- **Slab thickness**: 225mm
- **Cavity width**: 213mm
- **Support height**: -250mm
- **Issue**: Algorithm defaulted to 75mm fixing position when a better solution existed at 150mm (bottom of allowed zone)
- **Impact**: Suboptimal designs using more steel than necessary

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
1. **Examined brute force algorithm structure**
   - Located fixing position generation in `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/combinationGeneration.ts`
   - Analyzed combination generation logic in `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/index.ts`
   - Reviewed evaluation process in `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/evaluateDesign.ts`

2. **Channel specification analysis**
   - Reviewed `src/data/channelSpecs.ts` for edge distance requirements
   - Found 225mm slab has bottom critical edge of 150mm
   - Confirmed 200mm slab has bottom critical edge of 125mm

3. **Mathematical error discovered**
   - Current logic: `maxFixingDepth = slabThickness - bottomCriticalEdge`
   - For 225mm slab: `maxFixingDepth = 225 - 150 = 75mm`
   - **This created zero working zones!** (75mm to 75mm)

### Core Problem
The fixing position calculation was **mathematically backwards**:

**Incorrect logic**:
- Used channel-specific bottom critical edge values as maximum depth
- Resulted in single-position ranges (75mm only)
- No optimization possible across different fixing positions

**Correct logic should be**:
- Must maintain 75mm minimum from ANY edge (top OR bottom)
- Range should be: 75mm (from top) to (slab_thickness - 75mm) (75mm from bottom)

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

#### File: `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/combinationGeneration.ts`

**Before (lines 46-54)**:
```typescript
// Get bottom critical edge distance from channel specifications
const channelSpec = getChannelSpec("CPRO38", slabThickness, 300);
const bottomCriticalEdge = channelSpec ? channelSpec.edgeDistances.bottom : 150;

console.log(`Channel spec lookup: CPRO38/${slabThickness}/300 -> ${channelSpec ? channelSpec.id : 'not found'}`);
console.log(`Bottom critical edge: ${bottomCriticalEdge}mm`);

// Calculate maximum fixing depth: must maintain bottom critical edge from slab bottom
const maxFixingDepth = slabThickness - bottomCriticalEdge;
console.log(`Max fixing depth: ${slabThickness} - ${bottomCriticalEdge} = ${maxFixingDepth}mm`);
```

**After (lines 46-49)**:
```typescript
// Calculate maximum fixing depth: must maintain 75mm minimum from bottom edge
// This ensures fixing is always 75mm from either top or bottom critical edge
const maxFixingDepth = slabThickness - 75;
console.log(`Max fixing depth: ${slabThickness} - 75 = ${maxFixingDepth}mm`);
```

#### Additional Cleanup
- Removed unused imports (`SYSTEM_DEFAULTS`, `getChannelSpec`)
- Fixed lint issues in related files
- Cleaned up unused variables in evaluation logic

## Results & Verification

### Fixing Position Ranges Generated

| Slab Thickness | Previous Range | New Range | Working Zone |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| 200mm | 75mm only | 75mm - 125mm | 50mm |
| 225mm | 75mm only | 75mm - 150mm | 75mm |
| 250mm | 75mm only | 75mm - 175mm | 100mm |
| 300mm | 75mm only | 75mm - 225mm | 150mm |

### Test Implementation
Created comprehensive test suite: `test-scenarios/20250924103000-fixing-position-optimization-fix.test.ts`

**Test Coverage**:
1. ✅ Correct fixing position range generation for 225mm slab
2. ✅ Multiple slab thickness validation
3. ✅ Full optimization algorithm execution
4. ✅ Custom fixing position mode preservation

**Test Results**:
- 225mm slab now generates 16 positions: [75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150]
- All slab thicknesses show proper working zones
- Custom mode still respects user-specified positions

## Impact Assessment

### Performance Considerations
- **Combination count increased significantly**:
  - Before: ~1,000 combinations (single fixing position per structural combo)
  - After: ~17,000 combinations for 225mm slab (16 fixing positions per combo)
- **Optimization time**: Increased but acceptable for better results
- **Branch-and-bound pruning**: Still effective at reducing unnecessary evaluations

### Engineering Benefits
1. **Better optimization results**: Can now find truly optimal fixing positions

### Verification Steps
Users can now test the original problematic scenario:
- Input: 225mm slab, 213mm cavity, -250mm support height
- Expected: Algorithm should find optimal fixing position (likely 150mm) instead of defaulting to 75mm
- Result: Improved steel weight optimization

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Algorithm Flow
1. **Combination Generation**: Now creates comprehensive fixing position ranges
2. **Evaluation**: Each fixing position evaluated independently
3. **Optimization**: Best solution selected across all valid positions

# Progress Documentation - Inverted Bracket Calculation Fixes

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Problem**: Multiple issues with inverted and standard bracket calculations producing incorrect bracket heights and rise to bolts values

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Standard Bracket Minimum Height Not Enforced
- **Symptom**: Support level -75mm returning "No valid design found"
- **Root Cause**: Standard bracket calculation produced 40mm height (|−75| - 75 + 40 = 40mm), below structural minimum
- **Expected**: 150mm minimum for standard brackets

### Issue 2: Inverted Bracket Not Aligning with SSL
- **Symptom**: Support level 0mm with inverted bracket showing incorrect height
- **Root Cause**: Initial 170mm minimum was being applied universally instead of geometry-based calculation
- **Expected**: Bracket top should align with SSL at 0mm

### Issue 3: Rise to Bolts Constant Across Different Loads
- **Symptom**: Rise to bolts appeared identical regardless of load magnitude for inverted brackets
- **Root Cause**: Dim D values had large gaps (130, 150, 200mm) and slab geometry constrained maximum Dim D
- **Expected**: Rise to bolts should vary with optimization to find best solution

### Issue 4: Support Levels Between 0mm and -75mm
- **Symptom**: Support levels -25mm and -50mm showing incorrect bracket heights
- **Root Cause**: Calculation wasn't properly accounting for where angle sits inside slab
- **Expected**: Bracket should extend from angle position to appropriate depth

### Issue 5: Standard Angle Orientation at 0mm
- **Symptom**: 0mm support with Standard angle showed 210mm bracket instead of 264mm
- **Root Cause**: `bracket_top_position_from_ssl` wasn't including angle adjustment for Standard angles
- **Expected**: Standard angle vertical leg extends upward, requiring taller bracket

### Issue 6: Standard Bracket Rise to Bolts Incorrectly Constrained
- **Symptom**: Support level -130mm showing rise to bolts of 55mm instead of expected 95mm+
- **Root Cause**: `calculateRiseToBolts()` was applying `requiredRiseToBoltsToSupportLevel` constraint to both standard and inverted brackets
- **Expected**: This constraint only applies to inverted brackets

### Issue 7: Standard Bracket with Inverted Angle Geometry Error
- **Symptom**: Support level -130mm with Inverted angle showing 210mm bracket and 155mm rise to bolts, but angle bottom at -190mm doesn't align
- **Root Cause**: Vertical leg adjustment was simply being added to bracket height instead of calculating actual required geometry
- **Expected**: Bracket must extend from bracket top (40mm above fixing) to angle bottom (support_level - vertical_leg)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Standard Bracket Minimum Height Enforcement

**File**: `src/calculations/bracketCalculations.ts`

Added `STANDARD_BRACKET_MIN_HEIGHT: 150mm` constant and enforced in both:
- `calculateStandardBracketHeight()`
- `calculateStandardBracketHeightWithExtension()`

```typescript
// Enforce 150mm minimum height for standard brackets (structural minimum)
const min_standard_height = BRACKET_ANGLE_CONSTANTS.STANDARD_BRACKET_MIN_HEIGHT;
if (final_bracket_height < min_standard_height) {
    final_bracket_height = min_standard_height;
}
```

### 2. Inverted Bracket Geometry-Based Calculation

**File**: `src/calculations/bracketCalculations.ts`

Completely rewrote `calculateInvertedBracketHeight()` to use geometry-first approach:

```typescript
// Calculate bracket top position from SSL
if (support_level >= 0) {
    // Angle is above SSL (or at SSL for support_level = 0)
    bracket_top_position_from_ssl = support_level + angle_adjustment;
} else {
    // Angle is below SSL (inside slab)
    bracket_top_position_from_ssl = support_level; // negative value
}

// Calculate bracket bottom position
const bracket_bottom_from_ssl = -(effectiveFixingPosition + final_dim_d);

// Calculate bracket height from geometry
let final_bracket_height = Math.abs(bracket_top_position_from_ssl - bracket_bottom_from_ssl);
```

**Key Insight**: Bracket height = |bracket_top - bracket_bottom|, not a formula-based calculation.

### 3. Dim D Optimization Improvements

**File**: `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/combinationGeneration.ts`

Updated Dim D constants and generation:
- Changed min Dim D from 130mm to **135mm** (aligned with ShapeDiver)
- Updated inverted bracket min height from 170mm to **175mm** (135 + 40)
- Changed from 8 fixed values to **64 values in 5mm increments** (135-450mm)
- Added slab geometry constraint filtering:

```typescript
const max_dim_d_for_slab = slabThickness - fixingPosition;
const dimDValues = bracketAngleCombo.bracket_type === 'Inverted'
    ? POSSIBLE_DIM_D_VALUES.filter(d => d <= max_dim_d_for_slab)
    : [undefined];
```

### 4. Standard Angle Orientation Fix

**File**: `src/calculations/bracketCalculations.ts` (line 116)

Fixed bracket top position calculation for Standard angle orientation:

```typescript
// Calculate angle adjustment for Standard angle orientation
const angle_adjustment = (inputs.angle_orientation === 'Standard')
    ? (angle_height - angle_thickness)
    : 0;

// For positive support levels, include angle adjustment
if (support_level >= 0) {
    bracket_top_position_from_ssl = support_level + angle_adjustment;
}
```

### 5. Rise to Bolts Calculation Fix for Standard Brackets

**File**: `src/calculations/bracketAngleSelection.ts`

Modified `calculateRiseToBolts()` to differentiate between bracket types:

```typescript
// Determine bracket type from support level
const bracketType = determineBracketType(support_level);

if (bracketType === 'Standard') {
    // For standard brackets, rise to bolts is determined by bracket geometry only
    // It is NOT constrained by support level position (that constraint is for inverted brackets)
    actualRiseToBolts = Math.min(
        requiredRiseToBoltsFromBracket,
        maxRiseToboltsFromSlabGeometry
    );
} else {
    // For inverted brackets, rise to bolts is also constrained by support level
    const requiredRiseToBoltsToSupportLevel = Math.abs(support_level) - fixing_position;

    actualRiseToBolts = Math.min(
        requiredRiseToBoltsFromBracket,
        maxRiseToboltsFromSlabGeometry,
        requiredRiseToBoltsToSupportLevel
    );
}
```

**Key Insight**: Standard brackets have rise to bolts = bracket_height - Y - 15mm, NOT constrained by support level position.

### 6. Standard Bracket with Inverted Angle Geometry Fix

**File**: `src/calculations/bruteForceAlgorithm/index.ts` (lines 245-306)

Complete rewrite of vertical leg adjustment logic for mismatched orientations:

```typescript
if (genetic.bracket_type === 'Standard' && genetic.angle_orientation === 'Inverted') {
    // Standard bracket with Inverted angle:
    // - Bracket top is at: fixing_point + Y (e.g., -75 + 40 = -35mm)
    // - Angle horizontal leg is at: support_level (e.g., -130mm)
    // - Angle vertical leg extends DOWN from horizontal leg by vertical_leg amount
    // - Angle bottom is at: support_level - vertical_leg (e.g., -130 - 60 = -190mm)
    // - Bracket must extend from bracket_top to angle_bottom

    const fixing_point = -(genetic.fixing_position || top_critical_edge); // e.g., -75mm
    const bracket_top = fixing_point + Y; // e.g., -75 + 40 = -35mm
    const angle_bottom = inputs.support_level - genetic.vertical_leg; // e.g., -130 - 60 = -190mm

    bracket_height_calc = Math.abs(bracket_top - angle_bottom); // e.g., |-35 - (-190)| = 155mm

    // Enforce 150mm minimum for standard brackets
    const min_standard_height = BRACKET_ANGLE_CONSTANTS.STANDARD_BRACKET_MIN_HEIGHT;
    if (bracket_height_calc < min_standard_height) {
        bracket_height_calc = min_standard_height;
    }
}
```

**Key Insight**: Cannot simply add vertical_leg to bracket height. Must calculate actual geometry based on where bracket top and angle bottom are positioned.

## Final Bracket Calculation Logic

### Inverted Brackets (support_level > -75mm)

**Geometry**:
- Bracket top position depends on support level and angle orientation
- Bracket bottom = -(fixing_position + dim_d)
- Bracket height = |bracket_top - bracket_bottom|

**Constraints**:
- Min Dim D: 135mm
- Max Dim D: min(450mm, slab_thickness - fixing_position)
- Min bracket height: 175mm (135 + 40 clearance)
- Min clearance above fixing: 40mm

**Rise to Bolts**:
```
rise_to_bolts = dim_d - 15mm (worst-case slot position)
```

**Dim D Range**: 135-450mm in 5mm increments, filtered by slab geometry

### Standard Brackets (support_level ≤ -75mm)

**Base Calculation** (Standard bracket + Standard angle):
```
bracket_height = |support_level| - fixing_position + 40mm
minimum: 150mm
```

**With Inverted Angle** (Standard bracket + Inverted angle):
```
fixing_point = -fixing_position (e.g., -75mm)
bracket_top = fixing_point + 40mm (e.g., -35mm)
angle_bottom = support_level - vertical_leg (e.g., -130 - 60 = -190mm)
bracket_height = |bracket_top - angle_bottom| (e.g., |-35 - (-190)| = 155mm)
minimum: 150mm
```

**Rise to Bolts**:
```
rise_to_bolts = bracket_height - 40mm - 15mm
```

**Key Differences from Inverted**:
- NOT constrained by support level position in rise to bolts calculation
- Bracket extends from 40mm above fixing point downward
- With Inverted angle, must reach angle bottom (not just add vertical_leg)

## Verification Examples

### Example 1: Support Level -130mm with Standard Bracket + Inverted Angle (60mm)

**Inputs**:
- Support level (BSL): -130mm
- Bracket type: Standard
- Angle orientation: Inverted
- Angle: 60mm × 5mm (vertical_leg = 60mm)
- Fixing position: 75mm from SSL top

**Geometry**:
- Fixing point: -75mm
- Bracket top: -75 + 40 = **-35mm**
- Angle horizontal leg: -130mm
- Angle vertical leg extends down: to -130 - 60 = **-190mm**
- Bracket must reach: **-190mm**

**Results**:
- Bracket height: |-35 - (-190)| = **155mm** ✓
- Bracket bottom: -35 - 155 = -190mm ✓
- Rise to bolts: 155 - 40 - 15 = **100mm** ✓

### Example 2: Support Level -135mm with Standard Bracket + Inverted Angle (60mm)

**Inputs**:
- Support level (BSL): -135mm
- Same configuration as Example 1

**Geometry**:
- Bracket top: -35mm
- Angle bottom: -135 - 60 = **-195mm**

**Results**:
- Bracket height: |-35 - (-195)| = **160mm** ✓
- Rise to bolts: 160 - 40 - 15 = **105mm** ✓

### Example 3: Support Level 0mm with Inverted Bracket + Inverted Angle

**Inputs**:
- Support level: 0mm (at SSL)
- Bracket type: Inverted
- Dim D: 135mm

**Geometry**:
- Bracket top: 0mm (at SSL)
- Bracket bottom: -(75 + 135) = -210mm

**Results**:
- Bracket height: |0 - (-210)| = **210mm** ✓
- Rise to bolts: 135 - 15 = **120mm** ✓

## Critical Understanding: The Fixing Point Position

**Key Concept**: The fixing point is at the middle of the bracket connection, NOT at the bracket top.

- **Fixing point**: Where the bracket attaches to the cast-in channel
- **Y = 40mm**: Distance from bracket top to fixing point
- **Bracket top**: fixing_point + 40mm (e.g., -75 + 40 = -35mm)
- **Bracket bottom**: bracket_top - bracket_height

This means:
- **Above fixing**: 40mm of bracket
- **Below fixing**: (bracket_height - 40mm) of bracket

For standard brackets with inverted angles, the bracket must extend far enough below the fixing point to reach the angle bottom, which is determined by the support level and the vertical leg dimension.

## Impact Assessment
